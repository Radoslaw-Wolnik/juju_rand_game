# Dice Game Analysis Project

## Overview
This project provides a comprehensive game-theoretic analysis of a stochastic bit-flipping dice game with multi-round scoring. It includes theoretical analysis, simulation tools, and visualization capabilities to explore various aspects of the game's strategic depth.

## Components

1. **comprehensive_analysis.md**: An exhaustive game-theoretic analysis of the dice game, including mathematical formulations, strategic considerations, and computational approaches.

2. **comprehensive_analysis.py**: A Python module that implements various game theory analysis tools, including Nash Equilibrium calculation, dominating strategy identification, and evolutionary stable strategy simulation.

3. **another_one.md**: A supplementary analysis focusing on specific strategic aspects of the game, including probability distributions and move valuations.

## Features

- Detailed game rules explanation for both base and extended versions
- Probability distribution analysis of dice rolls
- Strategic analysis for both game modes
- Mathematical modeling using Markov chains and expected value calculations
- Computational complexity assessment
- Approximate solution methods (Monte Carlo Tree Search, Reinforcement Learning)
- Evolutionary game theory perspective
- Visualization tools for payoff matrices and strategy performance

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

To use the game theory analysis tools:

```python
from comprehensive_analysis import GameTheoryAnalyzer

# Create a payoff matrix
payoff_matrix = [
    [3, 1, 0],
    [2, 2, 1],
    [0, 3, 3]
]

analyzer = GameTheoryAnalyzer(payoff_matrix)

# Perform various analyses
ne = analyzer.find_nash_equilibrium()
dom_strategies = analyzer.dominating_strategies()
ess = analyzer.evolutionary_stable_strategy()

# Visualize results
analyzer.visualize_payoff_matrix()
```

## Extending the Project

To apply this analysis to your specific dice game implementation:

1. Generate payoff matrices by simulating games between different strategies.
2. Use the `GameTheoryAnalyzer` class to analyze these payoff matrices.
3. Implement game-specific heuristics and evaluation functions.
4. Extend the analyzer to handle the multi-round nature of the game.

## Future Work

- Implement subgame perfect equilibrium for multi-round games
- Add Bayesian game analysis for scenarios with incomplete information
- Develop a dynamic payoff matrix that updates based on the current game state
- Create a web-based interface for interactive strategy exploration
