(* Define the game state *)
Record GameState := mkGameState {
  board: nat;
  score: nat;
  round: nat

(* Define a move *)
Definition Move := nat.

(* Define the rules for a valid move *)
Definition is_valid_move (state: GameState) (move: Move) : Prop :=
  move <= 12 /\
  exists k, 2^(move-1) = k /\ (board state) mod (2^move) >= k.

(* Define the effect of a move on the game state *)
Definition apply_move (state: GameState) (move: Move) : GameState :=
  mkGameState
    ((board state) - 2^(move-1))
    (score state)
    (round state).

(* Theorem: A valid move always reduces the board state *)
Theorem valid_move_reduces_board:
  forall state move,
    is_valid_move state move ->
    board (apply_move state move) < board state.
Proof.
  intros state move H_valid.
  unfold is_valid_move in H_valid.
  destruct H_valid as [H_bound [k [H_k H_board]]].
  unfold apply_move, board.
  rewrite <- H_k.
  apply Nat.sub_lt.
  - assumption.
  - apply Nat.pow_pos_nonneg; auto with arith.
Qed.


(* Define what it means for a board state to be valid *)
Definition is_valid_board (b: nat) : Prop :=
  b <= 0xFFF.

(* Theorem: apply_move preserves board validity *)
Theorem apply_move_preserves_validity:
  forall state move,
    is_valid_board (board state) ->
    is_valid_move state move ->
    is_valid_board (board (apply_move state move)).
Proof.
  (* Proof goes here *)
Admitted.

(* Define game termination *)
Inductive game_terminated : GameState -> Prop :=
  | game_over : forall s,

(* Theorem: The game always terminates *)
Theorem game_always_terminates:
  forall initial_state,
    exists n, forall state,
      n_moves initial_state state n ->
      game_terminated state.
Proof.
  (* Proof goes here *)
Admitted.

(* Define score calculation *)
Definition calculate_score (b: nat) : nat :=

(* Theorem: Score is always non-negative and bounded *)
Theorem score_properties:
  forall state,
    0 <= calculate_score (board state) <= 78.
Proof.

Admitted.
