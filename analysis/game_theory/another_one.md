# Comprehensive Game Theory Analysis of the Dice Game

## Game Mechanics Review

### Base Game
- The game is played on a 12-bit board, initially with all bits turned on.
- Players roll two dice and attempt to turn off bits corresponding to the sum or a subset of the sum.
- A player's turn ends when they can't turn off any bits based on their roll.
- The score for each round is the sum of the values of the bits that remain on.
- The game is typically played for 5 rounds, with the lower total score winning.

### Extended Game
- Similar to the base game, but players alternate turns with opposing goals.
- Player A tries to turn off all bits, while Player B tries to turn on all bits.
- The game ends when either all bits are off (Player A wins) or all on (Player B wins).

## Probability Distribution

The probability distribution of dice rolls remains crucial:

| Sum | Probability | Bit Value |
|-----|-------------|-----------|
| 2   | 1/36        | 2         |
| 3   | 2/36        | 3         |
| 4   | 3/36        | 4         |
| 5   | 4/36        | 5         |
| 6   | 5/36        | 6         |
| 7   | 6/36        | 7         |
| 8   | 5/36        | 8         |
| 9   | 4/36        | 9         |
| 10  | 3/36        | 10        |
| 11  | 2/36        | 11        |
| 12  | 1/36        | 12        |

## Strategic Analysis

### Base Game Strategy

1. **Prioritize High-Value Bits**: 
   - Focus on turning off the highest value bits (10, 11, 12) whenever possible, as these contribute most to the score.
   - The expected value of turning off each bit, considering both its value and probability:
     * Bit 12: 12 * (1/36) = 0.333
     * Bit 11: 11 * (2/36) = 0.611
     * Bit 10: 10 * (3/36) = 0.833
     * Bit 9:   9 * (4/36) = 1.000
     * Bit 8:   8 * (5/36) = 1.111
     * Bit 7:   7 * (6/36) = 1.167 (highest expected value)

2. **Subset Strategy**: 
   - When unable to turn off a high-value bit directly, aim to create or use subsets that include high-value bits.
   - Example: If you roll a 9 and bit 9 is off, consider turning off 5 and 4 instead of 6 and 3, as it leaves more high-value bits available for future turns.

3. **Endgame Considerations**:
   - In the late game, turning off any available bit becomes crucial to avoid ending your turn prematurely.
   - The risk of not being able to move increases as more bits are turned off, so sometimes turning off a lower-value bit is preferable to risking no move.

4. **Probability Management**:
   - Keep track of which high-value bits are still on and adjust strategy based on the remaining probabilities.
   - As the game progresses, the relative value of middle bits (6-8) increases due to their higher probability.

### Extended Game Strategy

#### Player A (Turning bits off):
1. **High-Value Focus**: Prioritize turning off high-value bits (10-12) to make it harder for Player B to win quickly.
2. **Subset Creation**: Create subsets that allow turning off multiple high-value bits in future turns.
3. **Probability Exploitation**: Focus on bits 6-8 due to their higher probability, especially if high-value bits are already off.
4. **Endgame Strategy**: In the late game, focus on creating situations where any roll will allow turning off the remaining bits.

#### Player B (Turning bits on):
1. **High-Value Protection**: Keep high-value bits (10-12) on as a priority, as they're harder for Player A to turn off.
2. **Subset Denial**: Turn on bits that prevent Player A from creating favorable high-value subsets.
3. **Probability Exploitation**: Ensure bits 6-8 stay on as long as possible due to their higher probability of being rolled.
4. **Forced Move Creation**: Try to create board states where Player A has limited options, forcing them to turn off low-value bits.

## Mathematical Analysis

### Markov Chain Model

The game can be modeled as a Markov chain with 2^12 = 4096 states, each representing a unique board configuration.

State transition probabilities P(s' | s, a) depend on:
1. The current state s (board configuration)
2. The action a (which bits to turn on/off)
3. The probability of rolling each sum

### Expected Score Calculation

For the base game, we can calculate the expected score reduction for each move:

E[Score Reduction] = Σ (Bit Value * Probability of turning it off)

For example, turning off bit 7 has an expected score reduction of:
7 * (6/36) = 1.167

### Optimal Policy

An optimal policy π*(s) for each state s would minimize the expected cumulative score over all rounds for the base game, or maximize the probability of reaching the winning state for the extended game.

This can be computed using dynamic programming techniques such as value iteration:

V*(s) = min_a [R(s,a) + γ * Σ P(s'|s,a) * V*(s')]

Where:
- V*(s) is the optimal value function
- R(s,a) is the immediate reward (score reduction)
- γ is a discount factor (typically 1 for finite-horizon games)
- P(s'|s,a) is the transition probability

### Computational Complexity

Computing the exact optimal policy is computationally intensive due to the large state space. Approximation methods such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) or reinforcement learning techniques can be used to develop strong strategies without exhaustive computation.

## Empirical Analysis

Large-scale simulations can provide insights into:
1. Average game length for the extended version
2. Distribution of scores in the base game
3. Win rates for different strategies
4. Impact of going first vs. second in the extended game

## Strategic Implications

1. **Tempo**: In the extended game, Player A (turning off bits) has a slight advantage due to starting first and the nature of subset creation.
2. **Risk Management**: Balancing between aggressive high-value bit targeting and safer plays to ensure continued turns is crucial.
3. **Adaptability**: Optimal play requires constant re-evaluation of the board state and adjusting strategies accordingly.

## Conclusion

The optimal strategy for this game involves a delicate balance of probability management, value optimization, and adaptive play. While perfect play can be theoretically determined through extensive computation, practical strategies for human players should focus on:

1. Prioritizing high-value bits
2. Creating and exploiting favorable subsets
3. Managing probabilities of future rolls
4. Adapting to the current board state and game progression

Further empirical analysis through large-scale simulations would provide valuable insights into the long-term efficacy of various strategies and the overall balance of the game.
